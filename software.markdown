##  gro

Specification and simulation of multicellular genetic programs in E. coli and yeast, developed in Eric Klavins' lab at UW ([gro home page][1]).

##  NUPACK

Analysis and design of nucleic acid molecules and multistranded systems, developed in Niles Pierce's lab at Caltech ([NUPACK home page][2]).

##  Multistrand

Simulation of kinetics for multistranded nucleic acid systems at the secondary structure level. (Link coming soon; contact schaeffer at dna.caltech.edu for a pre-release version.)
Multistrand will soon be integrated with the domain-level strand displacement programming environment developed at Microsoft Research by Luca Cardelli and Andrew Phillips ([DSD][3])

##  Xgrow

Stochastic simulation of tile-based self-assembly, developed in Erik Winfree's lab at Caltech ([Xgrow home page][4]).

##  caDNAno

Computer-aided design of DNA origami nanostructures, developed in William Shih's lab at Harvard and Shawn Douglas' lab at UCSF ([caDNAno home page][5]).

##  Nanoengineer

Nanoengineer is a molecular nanotechnology CAD program developed by Nanorex, Inc. ([Nanrex home page][6]). Rothemund consulted on the DNA origami and structural DNA nanotechnology features.
