# Project MPP website

This is based on a subset the [template](https://github.com/douglaslab/templates/tree/master/project) we use for projects in the lab. We've omitted experiments, paper, and protocols.

## directory structure

## content description

### code

Source code lives here!

### data

Data lives here. Whenever possible, structure as json (your code should read and write json), or in its original raw format (e.g. tiff).

### meetings

What's happened recently? What's our plan?

### *outline.md*

This is bullet-point outline of the project. It can be considered a rough outline of the paper, but of course things can change before things get to the manuscript-writing phase, so this document should be the primary home of all the project ideas and questions until it's clear that it's time to write the paper.

### slides

Summary slides of the project that could be used for introducting the project, teaching, etc.


### website

Every project should ultimately be able to serve its own website. The site (e.g. jekyll, etc) should live here.
