We propose a theoretical framework that uses a novel DNA strand displacement mechanism to implement abstract chemical reaction networks (CRNs) on the surface of a DNA nanostructure, and show that surface CRNs can perform efficient algorithmic computation and create complex spatial dynamics. We argue that programming molecular behaviors with surface CRNs is systematic, parallel and scalable.
