A small and compact DNA cube with zeptoliter volume is constructed by means of a generalized DNA brick concept using short synthetic oligonucleotides with varying lengths. By mimicking design principles from the DNA origami technique, the DNA cube offers higher stability and assembly yields compared to other approaches. Its potential application as nanoscale fluorescent probe is demonstrated using super-resolution imaging.
