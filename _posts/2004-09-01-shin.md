Inspired by kinesin movement along a microtubule, we demonstrate a processive bipedal DNA walker. Powered by externally controlled DNA fuel strands, the walker locomotes with a 5 nm stride by advancing the trailing foot to the lead at each step. Real-time monitoring of specific bidirectional walker movement is achieved via multiplexed fluorescence quenching.
