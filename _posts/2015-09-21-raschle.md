Nanodiscs constitute a tool for the solubilization of membrane proteins in a lipid bilayer, thus offering a near-native membrane environment. Many membrane proteins interact with other membrane proteins; however, the co-reconstitution of multiple membrane proteins in a single nanodisc is a random process that is adversely affected by several factors, including protein aggregation. Here, we present an approach for the controlled co-reconstitution of multiple membrane proteins in a single nanodisc. The temporary attachment of designated oligonucleotides to individual membrane proteins enables the formation of stable, detergent-solubilized membrane protein complexes by base-pairing of complementary oligonucleotide sequences, thus facilitating the insertion of the membrane protein complex into nanodiscs with defined stoichiometry and composition. As a proof of principle, nanodiscs containing a heterodimeric and heterotrimeric membrane protein complex were reconstituted using a fluorescently labeled voltage-gated anion channel (VDAC) as a model system.
