Analysis of the spatial arrangement of molecular features enables the engineering of synthetic nanostructures and the understanding of natural ones. The ability to acquire a comprehensive set of pairwise proximities between components would satisfy an increasing interest in investigating individual macromolecules and their interactions, but current biochemical techniques detect only a single proximity partner per probe. Here, we present a biochemical DNA nanoscopy method that records nanostructure features in situ and in detail for later readout. Based on a conceptually novel auto-cycling proximity recording (APR) mechanism, it continuously and repeatedly produces proximity records of any nearby pairs of DNA-barcoded probes, at physiological temperature, without altering the probes themselves. We demonstrate the production of dozens of records per probe, decode the spatial arrangements of 7 unique probes in a homogeneous sample, and repeatedly sample the same probes in different states.The spatial organisation of nanostructures is fundamental to their function. Here, the authors develop a non-destructive, proximity-based method to record extensive spatial organization information in DNA molecules for later readout.
