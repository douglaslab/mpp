Thirty percent of the human proteome is composed of membrane proteins that can perform a wide range of cellular functions and communications. They represent the core of modern medicine as the targets of about 50 % of all prescription pharmaceuticals. However, elucidating the structure of membrane proteins has represented a constant challenge, even in the modern era. To date, only a few hundred high-resolution structural models of membrane proteins are available. This chapter describes the emergence of DNA nanotechnology as a powerful tool for the structural characterization of membrane protein using solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Here, we detail the large-scale synthesis of detergent-resistant DNA nanotubes that can be assembled into a dilute liquid crystal to be used as a weak-alignment media in solution NMR structure determination of membrane proteins.
