High-throughput methods for screening protein-protein interactions enable the rapid characterization of engineered binding proteins and interaction networks. While existing approaches are powerful, none allow quantitative library-on-library characterization of protein interactions in a modifiable extracellular environment. Here, we show that sexual agglutination of Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be reprogrammed to link interaction strength with mating efficiency using synthetic agglutination (SynAg). Validation of SynAg with 89 previously characterized interactions shows a log-linear relationship between mating efficiency and protein binding strength for interactions with Kds ranging from below 500 pM to above 300 Î¼M. Using induced chromosomal translocation to pair barcodes representing binding proteins, thousands of distinct interactions can be screened in a single pot. We demonstrate the ability to characterize protein interaction networks in a modifiable environment by introducing a soluble peptide that selectively disrupts a subset of interactions in a representative network by up to 800-fold. SynAg enables the high-throughput, quantitative characterization of protein-protein interaction networks in a fully defined extracellular environment at a library-on-library scale.
