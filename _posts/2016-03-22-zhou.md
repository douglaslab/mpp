DNA nanostructures are versatile templates for low cost, high resolution nanofabrication. However, due to the limited chemical stability of pure DNA structures, their applications in nanofabrication have long been limited to low temperature processes or solution phase reactions. Here, we demonstrate the use of DNA nanostructure as a template for high temperature, solid-state chemistries. We show that programmably shaped carbon nanostructures can be obtained by a shape-conserving carbonization of DNA nanostructures. The DNA nanostructures were first coated with a thin film of Al2O3 by atomic layer deposition (ALD), after which the DNA nanostructure was carbonized in low pressure H2 atmosphere at 800-1000 °C. Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM) data showed that carbon nanostructures were produced and the shape of the DNA nanostructure was preserved. Conductive AFM measurement shows that the carbon nanostructures are electrically conductive.
