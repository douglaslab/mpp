The interest in channel models in which the data is sent as an unordered set of binary strings has increased lately, due to emerging applications in DNA storage, among others. In this paper we analyze the minimal redundancy of binary codes for this channel under substitution errors, and provide several constructions, some of which are shown to be asymptotically optimal. The surprising result in this paper is that while the information vector is sliced into a set of unordered strings, the amount of redundant bits that are required to correct errors is asymptotically equal to the amount required in the classical error correcting paradigm.
