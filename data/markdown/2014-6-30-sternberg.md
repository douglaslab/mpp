Title: Exquisite Sequence Selectivity with Small Conditional RNAs.

Authors: Sternberg JB, Pierce NA

Journal: *Nano Lett. 2014 Jun 30*

Abstract: {u'#text': u'Dynamic RNA nanotechnology based on programmable hybridization cascades with small conditional RNAs (scRNAs) offers a promising conceptual framework for engineering programmable conditional regulation in vivo. While single-base substitution (SBS) somatic mutations and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are important markers and drivers of disease, it is unclear whether synthetic RNA signal transducers are sufficiently programmable to accept a cognate RNA input while rejecting single-nucleotide sequence variants. Here, we explore the limits of scRNA programmability, demonstrating isothermal, enzyme-free genotyping of RNA SBS cancer markers and SNPs using scRNAs that execute a conditional hybridization cascade in the presence of a cognate RNA target. Kinetic discrimination can be engineered on a time scale of choice from minutes to days. To discriminate even the most challenging single-nucleotide sequence variants, including those that lead to nearly isoenergetic RNA wobble pairs, competitive inhibition with an unstructured scavenger strand or with other scRNAs provides a simple and effective principle for achieving exquisite sequence selectivity.', u'-NlmCategory': u'UNLABELLED'}
