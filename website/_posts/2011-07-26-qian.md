The prospects of programming molecular systems to perform complex autonomous tasks have motivated research into the design of synthetic biochemical circuits. Of particular interest to us are cell-free nucleic acid systems that exploit non-covalent hybridization and strand displacement reactions to create cascades that implement digital and analogue circuits. To date, circuits involving at most tens of gates have been demonstrated experimentally. Here, we propose a simple DNA gate architecture that appears suitable for practical synthesis of large-scale circuits involving possibly thousands of gates.
